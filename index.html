                <p>My mission is to grow as a computer scientist while finding ways to make a real-world difference
with the skills I build along the way. I want to use technology to solve problems that matter,
especially those that can help underprivileged communities and make everyday life better for people. I believe
in working hard, learning from others, and keeping service at the center of what I do.</p></div>

                Our affinity diagram organizes the ideas about improving crosswalk safety and timing. 
                It breaks the problem into five categories (Who, When, How, Why, and Where) to identify key users and their needs. 
                It highlights walking students, runners, and off-campus residents who may often face timing and safety challenges at busy crossings. 
                The solutions focus on  a potential app and/or online tool that lets the users report or suggest better crossing times, with the goal of reducing wait times around campus, improving pedestrian safety, and coordinating with traffic signals.
