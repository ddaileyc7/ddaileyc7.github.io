                <h2>About me</h2>
                <p>My mission is to grow as a computer scientist while finding ways to make a real-world difference
with the skills I build along the way. I want to use technology to solve problems that matter,
especially those that can help underprivileged communities and make everyday life better for people. I believe
in working hard, learning from others, and keeping service at the center of what I do.</p></div>
